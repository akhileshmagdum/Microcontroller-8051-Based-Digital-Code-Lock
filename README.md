# Microcontroller-8051-based-digital-code-lock
The purpose of this project is to provide security at (house, ATM, office etc.) in this system the user will be able to register an unique password. This password is stored on the microcontroller. Whenever the correct password is entered, the controller will accordingly give instructions to the DC motor. The DC motor will perform the action to unlock the door.
